# MOS
MOS (Miniature or Minimal OS) is intended to be a blank-slate OS that includes the very basics and can be used for diagnostic and teaching purposes.
MOS is not currently functional and is a work in progress. Progress will be made available here once the initial skeleton for future work is functional. The existing repo only exists as a placeholder.
Considering current class load and responsibilities, initial files will likely be functional in 2-4 weeks from README commit date (Aug 21, 2025).
